# FROST: Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures

This module implements a threshold signature scheme based on the FROST protocol.
FROST has been originally designed in 2020 by Chelsea Komlo and Ian Goldberg, who presented it at
the 2020 International Conference on Selected Areas in Cryptography.

A technical report describing the protocol with further details is available at
the [Cryptology ePrint Archive (Paper 2020/852)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852).

Currently, FROST is undergoing an IETF standardization process ([status](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/)).

This module was originally developed by Bank of Italy as part of the [itcoin project](https://bancaditalia.github.io/itcoin/).

## Build

FROST is implemented as a module of the secp256k1 library. Currently, it is an experimental module.
To enable FROST, configure with `--enable-module-frost`:

    $ ./configure --enable-module-frost --enable-experimental

This library aims to have full coverage of the reachable lines and branches, also for the FROST module.
Run the tests:

    $ make check

## Compliance with the IETF Standardized version of FROST

FROST is an experimental module of the `secp256k1` library.

The implemented version follows the design choices of the original [FROST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852).
Later, different versions of FROST appeared in the literature (e.g. [ROAST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/550)); among them, the original authors of FROST concentrated their efforts to standardize a version at the [IETF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/).

In the long term, we would like to release an implementation of FROST fully compliant with the standard. To ease the process of development and adoption, in the following, we keep track of each function defined in the standard, indicating whether the implemented version is fully compliant or not.

### IETF Standard

We refer to [draft v12](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost-12.html) of the IETF standardization proposal of FROST.

#### Helper Functions (Section 4 of IETF Standard)

- [x] nonce_generate(): our implementation expects to receive random 32-byte as a parameter (we want to remove dependencies from random generators);
- [x] derive_interpolating_value()
- [x] encode_group_commitment_list(): in our implementation, this function is named `encode_group_commitments()`
- [x] participants_from_commitment_list(): in our implementation, it is implemented using arrays
- [x] binding_factor_for_participant()
- [x] compute_binding_factors()
- [x] compute_group_commitment()
- [ ] compute_challenge(): our implementation follows BIP-340 and initializes SHA256 with fixed midstate (SHA256("BIP0340/challenge")||SHA256("BIP0340/challenge"));

#### Two-Round FROST Signing Protocol (Section 5 of IETF Standard)

- [x] commit(): in our implementation, this function is named `secp256k1_frost_nonce_create()`
- [x] sign(): in our implementation, this function is named `secp256k1_frost_sign()`
- [x] aggregate(): in our implementation, this function is named `secp256k1_frost_aggregate()`
- [x] verify_signature_share()

#### Ciphersuite (Section 6 of IETF Standard)

This library only implements `FROST(secp256k1, SHA-256)`.
- [x] Group: secp256k1
- [ ] Hash, H1(m): requires hash-to-curve
- [ ] Hash, H2(m): requires hash-to-curve
- [ ] Hash, H3(m): requires hash-to-curve
- [x] Hash, H4(m);
- [x] Hash, H5(m);


### secp256k1-frost

The `FROST` module of `secp256k1-frost` implements supplementary functions, which are not included in the version of FROST under standardization.
The following list keeps track of such functions.

#### Keygen

The IETF standard does not include a distributed key generation protocol.
This library implements the DKG protocol described in the [FROST paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852) and implemented
by Chelsea Komlo in the prototype [FROST repository](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/ckomlo/frost/).

- secp256k1_frost_keygen_dkg_begin();
- secp256k1_frost_keygen_dkg_commitment_validate();
- secp256k1_frost_keygen_dkg_finalize();

#### Signature

Our implementation follows BIP-340, which requires using x-only coordinates of points.

- secp256k1_frost_sign(): to follow BIP-340, it adjusts the signature if the group commitment is odd.
- secp256k1_frost_aggregate(): differently from the standard, our implementation verifies each signature share before computing the aggregated signature.
- secp256k1_frost_aggregate(): to follow BIP-340, it returns the group commitment with even y coordinate.
- secp256k1_frost_verify(): verify an aggregated signature. This is equivalent to a tradition Schnorr verification (e.g., as implemented in `secp256k1_schnorrsig_verify()`)
